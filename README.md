# Project 3: datafun-03-analytics

## Objectives

Create a Python module that demonstrates skills in fetching data from the web, processing it using Python collections, and writing the processed data to different file formats.

## Create Github Repository

-GitHub Repository: datafun-03-analytics
-Documentation: README.md
-Script: anjana_analytics.py


## Clone to Vs Code

"Open VS Code terminal (PowerShell) and run the command 'git clone site_URL'."


## Adding files- Add a .py file to work in.
- Add requirements.txt to hold the required project modules.
- Add .venv to act as the virtual environment.
- Add a .gitignore file to hold the .venv file so that the virtual environment is not included in the rest of the Python environment.
